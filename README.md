### Author: Nadario Ferguson

Published April 10, 2022

Hello! I recently completed my Google Data Analytics Course, and would like to walk you through my approach using what I have learned, and how I have applied those skills in completing this capstone project.

### Scenario 

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

### Ask 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 

   1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
   2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
   3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

You will produce a report with the following deliverables: 

  1. A clear statement of the business task 
  2. A description of all data sources used 
  3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data 
  4. A summary of your analysis 
  5. Supporting visualizations and key findings 
  6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis 


#### Business Task

The goal of this analysis is to understand how annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently from casual riders


#### Data Source

We will be using the dataset supplied by the Google Data Analytics Certification. You can review the dataset [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)


### Data Cleaning Log

A review of my data wrangling and cleaning process can be reviewed here

### Analysis

After cleaning and organizing the data we were able to analyze the information provided and found a few interesting observations.

#### Number Of Rides Per Day By Usertype

Here we can see that members consistently utilize their subscription throughoutthe week and into the weekend. However, casual users have a low utilization rate throughout the weekday and experience a spike on the weekends.


#### Average Duration Of Rides By Usertype
